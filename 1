What happen when not using BGP EVPN between Leafs and Spines
Hi all,
So the question is simple as the title indicates :)
I use OSPF between 4 Leafs and 2 Spines.
Multicast trafic is well implemented (the spines will be acting as Anycast RP ..).
Config of VxLAN (VNI, Int NVE, ...) done.
Is it obligatory to use BGP EVPN to implement VxLAN ? What is the purpose of implementing it cause I see that OSPF carry well Multicast traffic between Leafs and Spines ?

Thanks in advance.

The multicast-based VXLAN is flood-and-learn mechanism with no control plane. Scalability is always an issue with flood & learn. Also running multicast in underlay may not work for everyone plus it cannot be used as a DCI solution.

Cisco vs Arista for a core switch
Wondering what peoples experiences are with going Arista over Cisco for a core switching infrastructure. We're almost exclusively a Cisco shop (route/switch/firewall/collab). I've been introducing alternate technologies very slowly and have decided to take a hard look at Arista for this next upgrade/migration/restructure. Main requirement is 10Gb port density for our main office and 40Gb for site interconnect to our DR facility. Right now I'm comparing between the 7050SX-64 (48x SFP+ and 4x QSFP+) and a C9500-40X-A (40x SFP+ and 2x QSFP+). Qty 2 for whichever is the winner.
